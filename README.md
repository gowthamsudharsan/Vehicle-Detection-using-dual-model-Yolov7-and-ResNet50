# Vehicle-Detection-using-dual-model-Yolov7-and-ResNet50
This is a comprehensive AI-powered system for vehicle detection and weather scene classification designed to work in adverse weather conditions.
1. YOLOv7 - For real-time object detection (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs) - BDD10K Dataset
2. ResNet50 - For weather scene classification (clear, foggy, rainy, snowy, etc.) - Kaggle Dawn Dataset

**PYTHON - 3.11.13 is suggested for issueless run and TRY running in virtual environment**\n
**NOTE: Make sure Dataset is downloaded and the ipynb file is in the same path as dataset**\n
**Run the ipynb file with making sure all the path and files are right and once models are trained, place both the models in a folder in the same path with app.py file - python app.py**\n
**Make sure all the libraries in README Training and README Gradio are installed**\n
**Navigate to the URL on the cmd prompt from app.py**\n
